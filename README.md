# vibrant-nav-portfolio

create me a portfolio website with a nav bar at the top of page with the name "Adam Shahin" at the far left of the nav bar and the four sections of the page on the right side of the nav bar: the about section, the qualifications section, the projects section, and the contact section. 

The about section will contain this:

Hi, I'm Adam!

I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and I call the vibrant Minneapolis area my home. My journey in tech is fueled by a passion for creating innovative solutions and a love for working in fast-paced environments where I can contribute to projects with meaningful outcomes.

Outside of my academic pursuits in computer science, my life is a tapestry of varied and dynamic interests. From the disciplined focus of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Kickboxing to the precision and thrill of ice fishing and snowmobiling in Minnesota's great outdoors, these activities endow me with persistence, strategy, and adaptability. My enthusiasm for cooking reflects my approach to software development: creative, innovative, and bold. These hobbies do more than just enrich my personal life; they also shape my professional approach, inspiring me to stay at the forefront of technology and trends.

My goal is to weave these diverse experiences into the fabric of my work, developing user-friendly applications and collaborating on cutting-edge projects to make a significant impact in the tech world.

        * 		- Created a machine-learning model capable of identifying handwritten digits utilizing the open-source TensorFlow library and the MNIST dataset.
        * 		- The machine-learning model achieved an accuracy of 93 percent on average.â€¨		â€¨â€¨â€¨Publish Subscribe System (PubSub)
â€¨â€¨
        * 		- PubSub is a publish-subscribe system that allows clients to join, leave, subscribe, unsubscribe, publish and ping.
        * 		- The system is comprised of two components: the server and the client.
        * 		- The server is implemented using the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) library rpyc and manages a list of clients and articles.
        * 		- The client uses the rpyc library to connect to the server and allows the user to make requests.
        * 		- Articles are received by clients using a UDP socket and a receive thread is started to listen for incoming articles.â€¨â€¨â€¨Tetris Variantâ€¨â€¨
        * 		- Implemented an animated Python GUI program to play a variant of the classic video game Tetris using the turtle library.
        * 		- Utilized object-oriented programming concepts to create classes that encapsulate the game's data and behavior. 
        * 		- Customized the game's play area size and color, making the game adaptable to different screen sizes.	â€¨

And finally, the contact section will look like this:
